**Our Approach:**  
Recognizing the significant hurdles in modern gene editing‚Äîprecise guide RNA design, maintaining optimal lab conditions, and ensuring data integrity‚Äîwe set out to build GeneTrust. Our core strategy was to synergistically combine specialized AI, real-time IoT monitoring, and the transparency of blockchain.

This involved several distinct technical pillars and their associated challenges:

1.  **AI-Powered Prediction (DNABERT & Groq):** We aimed to leverage a fine-tuned DNABERT model for accurate guide RNA prediction. The primary challenge (`Model Fine-Tuning`) involved extensive experimentation with tokenization, embedding strategies, and iterative optimization to ensure biological relevance and computational efficiency. Integrating Groq for rapid inference (`Groq Integration`) further required careful prompt engineering, model selection (balancing speed and accuracy on LPUs), especially for real-time tasks like interpreting lab commands or explaining blockchain events.

2.  **IoT-Driven Lab Monitoring:** To address experimental sensitivity, we integrated real-time environmental sensors. The `IoT Integration` challenge lay in establishing reliable data synchronization between sensors and our backend, tackling potential latency and connectivity issues to ensure continuous, accurate monitoring crucial for reproducibility.

3.  **Blockchain for Trust (Base):** We utilized the Base blockchain for secure data management. The `Blockchain Deployment` phase involved designing robust smart contracts for complex tasks like sample provenance tracking, immutable audit trails, granular access control, and workflow automation. Ensuring the correctness, security, and efficiency of these contracts required meticulous planning and testing.

4.  **System Cohesion:** The overarching `System Integration` challenge was merging these disparate technologies (Python ML, Node.js backend, Next.js frontend, IoT streams, Blockchain interactions, Groq APIs) into a seamless platform. This demanded careful orchestration, robust inter-process communication strategies (like the FastAPI bridge), and rigorous debugging to ensure smooth interaction between components.

Our development process was inherently iterative. We refined the user interface based on early feedback, addressed model latency through targeted optimizations in the Python environment and data serialization, and proactively built comprehensive backend error handling to manage the complexity of the integrated system. Our detailed methodology, particularly regarding the ML model integration and validation, is further elaborated in our research paper: [Integrated Genomic Analysis Platform for Disease Prediction and CRISPR-Based Correction with Groq AI Assistance and Base Blockchain Security](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OcGagvPWv3VIOOOnRxrxvKYWFugpBD3q).
