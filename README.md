**Example:** Problem Statement X ‚Äì Advancing Genomic Research with AI

üéØ Objective
GeneTrust AI Studio aims to accelerate genetic research by providing an integrated platform for scientists and researchers. It addresses the complexity of CRISPR workflows, the need for real-time data insights, and the importance of verifiable research steps. The platform leverages Groq's AI capabilities for data interpretation, prediction explanations, and interactive assistance, combined with Base blockchain integration for potential data integrity checks and process tracking, serving researchers in biotech and academia.

**Our Approach:**
We chose this problem to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI, blockchain technology, and practical laboratory research needs. Key challenges included integrating disparate technologies (Web3 wallets, real-time data streams via WebSockets, Groq AI, potential ML models, blockchain interaction) into a cohesive user experience. Our approach focused on a modular design with a distinct frontend (Next.js) and backend (Node.js/Express), using Groq for enhancing user interaction and data analysis, and exploring Base blockchain for research process transparency.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
**Core Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, Shadcn/ui, Zustand/Jotai (State Management), Wagmi/Viem (Web3), Socket.IO Client, Framer Motion, Recharts/Three.js (Visualizations)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB (with Mongoose), Socket.IO, JWT (Authentication), Groq SDK
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **APIs:** Groq API (Chat, potentially Image Generation), Internal REST API
- **Blockchain:** Base (via Wagmi/OnchainKit, Hardhat for local testing/deployment)
- **Hosting:** *(Specify where it's hosted, e.g., Vercel, AWS, etc.)*

**Sponsor Technologies Used:**
- **Groq:** Used extensively in the backend for AI-powered features: generating explanations for CRISPR predictions, providing interactive chat assistance, analyzing real-time lab data, and potentially generating visualizations.
- **Base:** Integrated via Wagmi and OnchainKit for user authentication (Smart Wallet connection), potentially displaying on-chain data relevant to research context, and exploring smart contract interactions for data integrity/provenance.
- **Monad:** *(Specify if/how Monad was used, e.g., "Explored for potential high-throughput data processing" or "Not used")*
- **Fluvio:** *(Specify if/how Fluvio was used, e.g., "Considered for managing real-time IoT data streams" or "Not used")*
- **Screenpipe:** *(Specify if/how Screenpipe was used, e.g., "Not used")*
- **Stellar:** *(Specify if/how Stellar was used, e.g., "Not used")*

üß™ How to Run the Project
**Requirements:**
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud like MongoDB Atlas)
- Groq API Key (obtainable from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys))
- Base RPC URL and WalletConnect Project ID (for Web3 features, obtainable from providers like Infura/Alchemy and WalletConnect Cloud)

**.env File Setup:**
Both the `frontend` and `backend` directories require environment variable configuration.
- Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and fill in:
    - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    - `JWT_SECRET`: A secure secret for signing tokens.
    - `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key.
    - `PORT`: (Optional) Backend server port (defaults likely exist).
    - Other variables as needed (e.g., email service credentials if used).
- Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and fill in:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The full URL to your running backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api`).
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`: Your WalletConnect Cloud project ID.
    - Variables for Base RPC URL if needed by Wagmi config.

**Local Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-team/project-name # Replace with your repo URL
    cd project-name
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend

    # Set up backend/.env file as described above
    ```

3.  **Start Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the backend directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(The backend should now be running, typically on a port like 8000)*

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # Navigate back to root, then into frontend
    npm install
    # Set up frontend/.env.local file as described above
    ```

5.  **Start Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the frontend directory
    npm run dev
